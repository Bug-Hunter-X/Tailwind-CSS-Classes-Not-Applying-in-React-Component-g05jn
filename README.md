# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to a specific React component despite seemingly correct implementation. The problem is isolated to a single component, and standard debugging techniques did not immediately reveal the cause.

## Bug Description

Tailwind CSS classes are not being rendered in a particular React component. The component's structure and class names appear correct, and there are no obvious syntax errors or conflicting styles. The issue only occurs within this specific component.  This bug was solved by ensuring the parent component correctly passed down the props needed for the child component to render the class names, and the class names were correctly applied in the child component.
