The problem was solved by ensuring that the parent component correctly passed down the props needed for the child component to render the class names. The class names were correctly applied in the child component, but the issue was the parent component wasn't providing the necessary props.

Here's the corrected code for the parent component:

```jsx
// ParentComponent.jsx

function ParentComponent() {
  const className = "bg-blue-500 text-white p-4";

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent className={className} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

And the corrected code for the child component:

```jsx
// ChildComponent.jsx

function ChildComponent({ className }) {
  return (
    <div className={className}>
      This text should be blue with white text!
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;
```
By explicitly passing and using the `className` prop, the Tailwind classes are correctly applied.
